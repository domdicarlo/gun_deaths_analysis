# Exploring Gun Deaths in America
By Dominic DiCarlo

## About
The .Rmd file in this package performs some analysis on gun death data in America from the years 2012-2014. It plots some graphs and explanations on visible trends. This was originally part of a homework assignment for the Computing for Social Sciences Class at the University of Chicago, a graduate course in the Computational Social Sciences program. 

The data was originally published on the data journalism site [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/).

## Navigation 
The .Rmd file is found in this directory. Links to important documents are below. I have included github markdown and an html copy of the analysis.
